## Creating a 3D Scene Across Multiple Windows with Three.js and Local Storage, Enhanced with TextureLoader

The primary focus of this exploration is the development of a 3D scene distributed across multiple windows using the Three.js library, supplemented with the integration of localStorage. Additionally, the implementation is enriched by incorporating the TextureLoader to manage and apply textures to the 3D elements within the scene. This comprehensive approach delves into not only the spatial arrangement of the 3D environment across various windows but also the enhanced visual aspects achieved through the TextureLoader feature.

# Project Deployment Guide

To view and develop your project, it's essential to run it in a server environment. There are several methods to accomplish this, and the following detailed explanations cover these steps:

## Using Visual Studio Code - Live Server Extension:

- If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the "Live Server" extension proves to be extremely useful.
- Install the extension by searching for "Live Server" in the Extensions menu on the left and completing the installation.
- Then, open the HTML file in the root directory of your project, and by clicking the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner, initiate a live server.

## Deploying on Platforms like Vercel:

- Platforms such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) offer services to easily distribute and publish your projects.
- If you have a Vercel account, open a terminal in the root directory of your project and install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`.
- Then, use the `vercel` command to deploy your project. The platform will provide you with a URL, and your project will be live.

## Other Alternatives:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and many other platforms can help you deploy your projects.
- Consult the documentation of each platform to learn how to publish your project according to its requirements.

Choose the platform based on your project's needs. These steps cover fundamental methods to deploy your project live.
